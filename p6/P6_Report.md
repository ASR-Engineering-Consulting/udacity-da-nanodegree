## Summary
Within this project the well-known [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) dataset is anaylzed. The focus of the anaylsis is to investigate
why certain passengers survived the accident any why other did not. My visualzation provides an overview of
the main feature of the data set and highlights some interesting attributes of survivors and non-survivors.

## Design
In order to make the visualization appealing and effective, I took the following design decisions
* Chart types (bar charts for comparisons between items with few categories, histograms for distributions, scatter plots for relationships)
* Focus on position, size and color saturation as main design elements
* Usage of a color palette suitable for color-blinds
* Usage of the same color palette accross all visualizations

## Feedback
In order to improve my visualization I requested feedback from two coworkers.
The first coworker did provide feedback related to design elements, i.e.:
* Usage of a consistent color palette (my first iteration did not honour my own design concept)
* Improved format of axes (rotation of labels for better readability)
* Omitting dedicated legends if labels and color palette were already conveying all necessary information
* Limits on the number of objects on dashboards

I did implement all of his advice.

The Second coworker focused on an entirely different aspect of the visualizatin, the story.
In essence she advised me to:
* Use visualizations as filters to easily differentiate between sex
